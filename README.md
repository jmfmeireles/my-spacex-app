# My Space X App

Responsive web app with the purpose of displaying information about the last 10 Space X missions.

## Relevant Technologies
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, an interesting technology which I had curiosity to try. Next.js is great to build performant web apps due to the fastest pages loading times and to bring features like Search Engine Optimization.
- <a href="https://mui.com/">Apollo Client</a>is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Managing data with Apollo Client allows to take advantage of GraphQL as a unified interface to all of data.

## Next improvements
- Performance optimisation on loading time (explore caching)
- Include error handling on pages
- Implement styled components and, after that, include a light theme
- Optimise image loading (maybe by adding a blur effect)
